# angelpilled's configs

Hi. This repository contains all my config files regarding Linux packages.
Each package configs are listed in different directories.

A build.sh can be found in a few directories, like the suckless directory. This shell script will build all the files for the respected softwares containing my configuration files. **A README file is given for every directory. Software keybindings like** `dwm` **will be clarified in their respective README files.**

## Features

+ fully functional suckless softwares with my configs (dwm, st, dmenu, slstatus)
+ neovim configurations
+ .bashrc config

& more in the future!
