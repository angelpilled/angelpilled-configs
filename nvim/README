neovim configurations

Requirements:
+ neovim
+ git
+ yarn
+ nodejs
+ npm
+ VimPlug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

Configuration installation

Append the desired lines of init.vim to your existing init.vim file (or copy the file to /home/user/.config/nvim). Type in :PlugInstall.
Navigate to the /home/user/.local/share/nvim/plugged/coc.nvim/ directory, and execute the "yarn install", then "yarn build" command.
The command ":CocInstall coc-pairs", will install bracket pairing. For C auto completion, type in ":CocInstall coc-clangd", then open a .c file in with neovim. After that, type in ":CocCommand clangd.install" to install C auto completion.
I disabled clangd's auto formatting, as it was quite annoying while writing code. This line can be found as `"inlayHint.enable": false` in the coc-settings.json file. Simply append that line or copy this file to your /home/user/.config/nvim/ directory. Clangd inlayHints will be disabled now.
