Suckless softwares (dwm, st, dmenu, slstatus)
https://suckless.org/

Requirements:
+ make
+ gcc
+ webkit2gtk
+ gcr

Optional (you can change these in the config.h files):
+ ttf-profont-nerd

To build the files, you must either
1) run the build.sh script (this will build all the suckless softwares individually, requires the make package)
2) manually go in the suckless directories and use the make commands.
